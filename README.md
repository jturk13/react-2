I was tasked to write a function called ***unroll***, which takes in a square array of arrays (i.e. a grid with *n* rows and *n* columns).
***unroll*** should take in such a square array and return a single array containing the values in the square. You should obtain the values by traversing the square in a spiral: from the top-left corner, move all the way to the right, then all the way down, then all the way to the left, then all the way up, and repeat.
